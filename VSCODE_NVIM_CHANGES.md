# VSCode NVIM Configuration Changes Summary

## Overview
Your Neovim configuration has been successfully configured to work with the VSCode NVIM extension.

## Modified Files

### 1. `nvim/init.lua` 
**Changes**: Added VSCode detection at entry point
```
- Wraps all configuration in if/else based on vim.g.vscode
- VSCode mode: Loads only vscode-settings.lua and keymaps.lua
- Neovim mode: Loads full configuration (lazy.nvim, LSP, formatting, etc.)
```

### 2. `nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua`
**Changes**: Added VSCode-aware plugin loading
```
- Plugins only import when NOT in VSCode: { import = "plugins", cond = not vim.g.vscode }
- Plugin update checker only enabled in standalone Neovim: checker = { enabled = not vim.g.vscode }
```

## New Files Created

### 1. `nvim/lua/user/vscode-settings.lua` (NEW)
**Purpose**: VSCode-specific settings and optimizations
- Disables line numbers (VSCode provides these)
- Disables cursor line/column (VSCode handles this)
- Disables unused providers (ruby, perl, node)
- Performance-optimized timeouts
- Early return if not in VSCode

### 2. `nvim/lua/plugins/vscode.lua` (NEW)
**Purpose**: VSCode-compatible plugins that enhance vim editing
- tpope/vim-repeat - Better . repeating
- tpope/vim-surround - Surround operations  
- wellle/targets.vim - Better text objects
- mg979/vim-visual-multi - Multiple cursor support
- All conditionally loaded only in VSCode: `cond = vim.g.vscode`

### 3. `VSCODE_NVIM_SETUP.md` (NEW)
**Purpose**: User guide for VSCode NVIM configuration

## Unchanged Files
- `nvim/lua/user/keymaps.lua` - Works in both VSCode and standalone Neovim
- All other configuration files - Untouched, work as before in standalone Neovim

## How to Use

### With VSCode NVIM Extension
1. Install "Neovim" extension in VSCode
2. Point it to your Neovim installation
3. Your keymaps and lightweight plugins automatically load

### With Standalone Neovim
```bash
nvim
```
All plugins and full configuration load normally.

## Test Your Setup

Verify in VSCode that `vim.g.vscode` is true:
```vim
:lua print(vim.g.vscode)
```

Expected output in VSCode: `true`
Expected output in standalone Neovim: `nil`

## Benefits

✅ Single configuration for both VSCode and Neovim  
✅ No conflicts between VSCode UI and Neovim features  
✅ Lightweight in VSCode (no unnecessary plugins)  
✅ Full-featured in standalone Neovim  
✅ Keybindings work identically in both  
✅ Easy to customize for either environment
